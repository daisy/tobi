					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp34" id="dtb31">"Cursed flatterer!" </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp35" id="dtb32">muttered Michael Angelo in a low voice.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb33" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp36">"Come, come, I will take charge of this matter myself," said the Pope. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp37" id="dtb34">"You shall only make three statues with your own hand: the rest shall be given to other sculptors, and I will answer for the Duke of Urbino's consent. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp38" id="dtb35">And now, Maestro, to the Sistine Chapel. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp39" id="dtb36">A great empty wall is waiting for you there."</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp40" id="dtb37">What could Michael Angelo reply to such an emphatic wish expressed so distinctly? </sent><sent id="dtb38" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp41">He finished in his best style his two statues of <em>Active Life</em> and <em>Contemplative Life</em>—Dante's symbolical Rachel and Leah—and not wishing to profit by this new arrangement to which he was forced to submit, he added fifteen hundred and twenty-four ducats to the four thousand he had received, to pay with his own gains for the works confided to the other artists.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp42" id="dtb39">Having thus terminated this unfortunate affair, which had caused him so much worry and fatigue, Michael Angelo was at last enabled to occupy himself exclusively with the execution of his <em>Last Judgment</em>, to which he devoted no less than eight to nine years.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp43" id="dtb40">This immense and unique picture, in which the human figure is represented in all possible attitudes, where every sentiment, every passion, every reflection of thought, and every aspiration of the soul are rendered with inimitable perfection, has never been equalled and never will be equalled in the domain of Art.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp44" id="dtb41">This time the genius of Michael Angelo simply attacked the infinite. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp45" id="dtb42">The subject of this vast composition, the manner in which it is conceived and executed, the admirable variety and the learned disposition of the groups, the inconceivable boldness and firmness of the outlines, the contrast of light and shade, the difficulties, I might almost say the impossibilities vanquished, as if it were all mere play, and with a happiness that savours of prodigy, the unity of the whole and the perfection of the details, make <em>The Last Judgment</em> the most complete and the greatest picture in existence. </sent><sent id="dtb43" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp46">It is broad and magnificent in effect, and yet each part of this prodigious painting gains infinitely when seen and studied quite near; and we do not know of any easel-picture worked upon with such patience and finished with such devotion.</sent></p>

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp48" id="dtb44">The painter could only choose one scene, several isolated groups, in this appalling drama which will be enacted on the last day in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, where all the generations of man shall be gathered together. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp49" id="dtb45">And yet, admire the omnipotence of genius! </sent><sent id="dtb46" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp50">With nothing but a single episode in a restricted space, and solely by the expression of the human body, the artist has succeeded in striking you with astonishment and terror, and in making you really a spectator of the supreme catastrophe.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb47" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp51">At the base of the picture, very nearly in the centre, you perceive the boat of the <em>Inferno</em>, a fantastic reminiscence borrowed from Pagan tradition, in accordance with which first the poet and then the painter were pleased to clothe an accursed being with the form and occupation of Charon.</sent></p>
					<p><sent><span id="dtb48" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp52">"Charon with the eyes of burning embers gathering together with a gesture all these souls, and striking with his oar those who hesitate."</span><noteref id="dtb49" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp53" idref="#footnote-1" class="Footnote">1</noteref> </sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp54" id="dtb50">It is impossible to form an idea of the incredible science displayed by Michael Angelo in the varied contortions of the damned, heaped one upon the other in the fatal bark. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp55" id="dtb51">All the violent contractions, all the visible tortures, all the frightful shrinkings that suffering, despair, and rage can produce upon human muscles are rendered in this group with a realism that would make the most callous shudder. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp56" id="dtb52">To the left of this bark you see the gaping mouth of a cavern; this is the entrance to Purgatory, where several demons are in despair because they have no more souls to torment.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp57" id="dtb53">This first group, which very naturally attracts the spectator's attention, is that of the dead whom the piercing sound of the eternal trumpet has awakened in their tombs. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp58" id="dtb54">Some of them shake off their shrouds, others with great difficulty open their eyelids made heavy by their long sleep. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp59" id="dtb55">Towards the angle of the picture there is a monk who is pointing out the Divine Judge with his left hand; this monk is the portrait of Michael Angelo.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb56" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp60">The second group is formed of the resuscitated ones who ascend of themselves to the Judgment. </sent><sent id="dtb57" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp61">These figures, many of which are sublime in expression, rise more or less lightly into space, according to the burden of their sins, of which they must render account.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb58" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp62">The third group, also ascending to the right of Christ, is that of the Blessed. </sent><sent id="dtb59" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp63">Among all these saints, some of whom show the instrument of their execution, others the marks of their martyrdom, there is one head especially remarkable for beauty and tenderness: it is that of a mother who is protecting her daughter, turning her eyes, filled with faith and hope, towards the Christ.</sent></p>

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp66" id="dtb61">Above the host of saints, you see a fourth group of angelic spirits, some bearing the Cross, others the Crown of Thorns,—instruments and emblems of the Saviour's Passion.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp67" id="dtb62">The fifth group, parallel to the fourth which we have just pointed out, is composed of angels; such, at least, they seem to be by the splendour of their youth and the aërial lightness of their movements; and these also bear, as if in triumph, other emblems of the divine expiation—the column, the ladder, and the sponge.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp68" id="dtb63">Above these angels, on the same plane as the saints and to the left of Christ, is the choir of the just; the patriarchs, the prophets, the apostles, the martyrs, and the holy personages form this sixth group.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp69" id="dtb64">The seventh is the most horrible of all and the one in which the art of Michael Angelo has displayed itself in all its terrific grandeur: it is composed of the rejected ones, overwhelmed by the decree and led away to punishment by the rebel angels. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp70" id="dtb65">The very coldest spectator could not remain unmoved by this spectacle. </sent><sent id="dtb66" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp71">You believe yourself in hell; you hear the cries of anguish and the gnashing of the teeth of the wretched, who, according to the terrible Dantesque expression, vainly desire a second death.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb67" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp72">The eighth, ninth, and tenth groups, occupying the base of the composition, are composed, as we have already said, of the bark of Charon, the grotto of Purgatory, and the Angels of Judgment, eight in number, blowing their brazen trumpets with all their might to convoke the dead from the four quarters of the earth.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb68" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp73">Finally, in the eleventh group, in the centre, very near the upper part of the picture, between the two companies of the blessed, and seated upon the clouds, the sovereign Judge with a terrible action hurls his malediction upon the condemned: <em>"Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum."</em> </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp74" id="dtb69">The Virgin turns away her head and trembles. </sent><sent id="dtb70" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp75">On Christ's right is Adam, and on his left, St. </sent><sent id="dtb71" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp76">Peter. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp77" id="dtb72">They have exactly the same positions assigned to them by Dante in his <em>Paradiso</em>.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb73" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp78">This immense work was exhibited to the public on Christmas Day, 1541. </sent><sent id="dtb74" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp79">It had cost eight years of work. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp80" id="dtb75">Michael Angelo was then sixty-seven years old.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb76" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp81">Several anecdotes relating to this great picture have come down to us.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp82" id="dtb77">It is related that the Pope, scandalized at the nudity of certain figures, a nudity which Daniele da Volterra was afterwards charged to clothe, sent word to Michael Angelo that he must cover them.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb78" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp83">Michael Angelo replied with his usual brusqueness:</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb79" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp84">"Tell the Pope that he must employ himself a little less in correcting my pictures, which is very easy, and employ himself a little more in reforming men, which is very difficult."</sent></p>
					<pagenum page="normal" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp85" id="page6">6</pagenum>
					<p><sent id="dtb80" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp86">It is said that Maestro Biaggio, master of ceremonies to Paul III., having accompanied the Pope on a visit that His Holiness made to see Michael Angelo's fresco when it was about half finished, allowed himself to express his own opinion upon <em>The Last Judgment</em>.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp87" id="dtb81">"Holy Father," said the good Messer Biaggio, "if I dare pronounce my judgment, this picture seems more appropriate to figure in a tavern than in the chapel of a Pope."</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb82" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp88">Unfortunately for the master of ceremonies, Michael Angelo was behind him and did not lose a word of Messer Biaggio's compliment. </sent><sent id="dtb83" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp89">The Pope had scarcely gone before the irritated artist, wishing to make an example as a warning for all future critics, placed this Messer Biaggio in his hell, well and duly, under the scarcely flattering guise of Minos. </sent><sent id="dtb84" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp90">That was always Dante's way when he wanted to avenge himself upon an enemy.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp91" id="dtb85">I leave you to imagine the lamentations and complaints of the poor master of ceremonies when he saw himself damned in this manner. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp92" id="dtb86">He threw himself at the Pope's feet, declaring that he would never arise unless His Holiness would have him taken out of hell: that was the most important thing. </sent><sent id="dtb87" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp93">As for the punishment, that the painter deserved for this dreadful sacrilege, Messer Biaggio would leave that entirely to the high impartiality of the Holy Father.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb88" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp94">"Messer Biaggio," replied Paul III. with as much seriousness as he could maintain, "you know that I have received from God an absolute power in heaven and upon the earth, but I can do nothing in hell; therefore you must remain there."</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp95" id="dtb89">While Michael Angelo was working at his picture of <em>The Last Judgment</em>, he fell from the scaffold and seriously injured his leg. </sent><sent id="dtb90" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp96">Soured by pain and seized with an attack of misanthropy, the painter shut himself up in his house and would not see any one.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb91" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp97">But he reckoned without his physician; and the physician this time was as stubborn as the invalid.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb92" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp98">This excellent disciple of Æsculapius was named Baccio Rontini. </sent><sent id="dtb93" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp99">Having learned by chance of the accident that had befallen the great artist, he presented himself before his house and knocked in vain at the door.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp100" id="dtb94">No response.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp101" id="dtb95">He shouted, he flew into a passion, and he called the neighbours and the servants in a loud voice.</sent></p>
					<p><sent id="dtb96" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp102">Complete silence.</sent></p>
					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp103" id="dtb97">He goes to find a ladder, places it against the front of the house, and tries to enter by the casements. </sent><sent id="dtb98" smilref="speechgen0003.smil#tcp104">The windows are hermetically sealed and the shutters are fast.</sent></p>

					<p><sent id="dtb429" smilref="speechgen0007.smil#tcp451">In this quest of beauty, our curious minds, which know so many things and which have been able to compare the works of the most diverse civilizations, are perpetually seeking novelty, eager for rare forms, and inimical to everything banal and to everything that ordinary life brings before our eyes. </sent><sent smilref="speechgen0007.smil#tcp452" id="dtb430">And in our <em>fin de siècle</em> we have been so much the more prone to subtle pursuits because for some time our French art has seemed to take delight in the forms of a gross realism.</sent></p>

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0007.smil#tcp482" id="dtb457">And around this scene, what a beautiful frame of verdure and flowers! </sent><sent id="dtb458" smilref="speechgen0007.smil#tcp483">Nature has donned her richest festal robes; the inanimate things, like the human beings, all speak of love and happiness, and tell us that the master of this world is that little child with bandaged eyes, who amuses himself by shooting his arrows of fire.</sent></p>

					<p><sent smilref="speechgen0007.smil#tcp489" id="dtb463">To say a word about the technique of this work, we should remark that Botticelli always painted in fresco or distemper, and that he did not seek the supple modelling that painting in oil affords; and, on the other hand, he submitted profoundly to the influence of Pollaiolo; he observed Nature with the eyes of a goldsmith; and he painted his works as if, working a niello or enamel, he had to set each figure in gold-wire.</sent></p>
